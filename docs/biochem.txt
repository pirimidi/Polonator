     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, cycle_name, flowcell, logger)

     |      making sure that there is no left over reagent leading to or in the syringe pump after a biochemistry step.
     |      This function also flushes the flowcell, thus incorporates the 'flowcell_flush' procedure inherently.
     |  
     |  cycle_ligation(self)
     |      Performs a cycle of polony sequencing biochemistry consisting of:
     |      
     |      - chemical stripping
     |      - primer hybridization
     |      - query nonamer ligation (stepup temperature, peg)
     |      
     |      Reagent requirements:
     |      
     |      - see 'cycle_list' valve-port map in configuration file
     |  
     |  draw_air_to_mixer(self, gap_size)
     |      Draws a specific volume of air plug to mixing chamber's input/output needle
     |  
     |  draw_air_to_syringe(self)
     |      Draws a specific volume of air plug to syringe's COM-port.
     |  
     |  draw_air_to_valve(self, valve)
     |      Draws a 60 ul volume of air plug in front of specified valve COM-port

     |  exo_start(self)
     |      Digests unprotected bead-bound ePCR primers with Exonuclease I using rotary
     |      valve 2 to prepare polony sequencing. Does the following:
     |      
     |      - incubate reaction mix at 'exo_set_temp' for 'exo_time' minutes
     |      - flush flowcell with 'Wash 1'
     |      
     |      Reagent requirements:
     |      
     |      - V2-6 : 625 ul reaction mix
     |      - V3-2 : 650 ul 'Wash 1'
     |  
     |  fill_with_air_to_valve(self, valve)
     |      Fills tube with air to specified valve COM-port and sets discrete valve V7 
     |      open to dH2O as default state.
     |  
     |  flush_flowcell(self, port)
     |      Flushes flowcell 3-times with 'Wash 1' or dH2O.
     |  
     |  get_config_parameters(self)
     |      Retieves all biochemistry and device related configuration parameters from the confi-
     |      guration file using the ConfigParser facility. It assigns each parameter to a field of 
     |      the biochemistry object, thus it can access it any time during a run.
     |  
     |  get_excel_volumes(self)
     |      Extracts path length and tube cross-sectional area information from standard Excel file
     |      containing all internal and external volume calculations in the G.007 fluidics sub-system.
     |      It automatically calculates total path volumes in both cases, creating a dictionary object
     |      holding volume data specified by the following format:
     |      
     |              volumes[point_B][point_A] = 'total path volume from point A to point B in the system'
     |      
     |      This function creates two dictionary objects as fields of the 'Biochem' object: one for
     |      volume calculations internal, while the other for volume calculations external to manifold
     |      respectively.
     |      
     |      If changes occur in either path length or cross-sectional area data, the numbers must be
     |      updated accordingly, but the file format and data tabulation cannot be changed.
